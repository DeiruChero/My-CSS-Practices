<h1> EMOH YEHO lyrics </h1>
<p>
I don't want to leave it complicated<br>
I don't wanna leave alone<br>
I don't<br>
I can make it all fallen maybe<br>
I don't wanna leave alone<br><br>

Throwing what that I won't say<br>
Spit it all crashback replay<br>
Cause I don't wanna care again for you<br><br>

You go your own way<br>
You go your own way<br>
Your own way<br><br>

I can leave your conversation<br>
If the words come to slow<br>
And maybe this won't be meant to be<br>
But I knew I find my home<br><br>

And I don't want to leave this complicated<br>
I don't wanna leave alone<br>
I know<br>
I can make it all fallen maybe<br>
I know I can change alone<br><br>

You need to me that I were<br>
The least that I want to watch you hurt<br>
Cause I'm looking for consolation<br>
And I need to call my own<br><br>

Cause I can't quite explain<br>
What's going on<br>
It's only gonna hurt again<br>
You go your own way<br>
You go your own way<br>
Your own way<br><br>

I can leave your conversation<br>
If the words come to slow<br>
And maybe this won't be meant to be<br>
But I knew I find my home<br><br>

And I don't want to leave this complicated<br>
I don't wanna leave alone<br>
I know<br>
I can make it all fallen maybe<br>
I know I can change alone<br><br>

And I don't want to leave this complicated<br>
I don't wanna leave alone<br>
I know<br>
I can make it all fallen maybe<br>
I know I can change alone<br><br>

And I don't want to leave this complicated<br>
I don't wanna leave alone<br>
I know<br>
I can make it all fallen maybe<br>
I know I can change alone<br><br>

You go your own way<br>
Your own way<br>
Your own way<br>
You go your own way<br>
Your own way<br><br>
